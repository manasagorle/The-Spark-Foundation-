# The-Spark-Foundation-
This Task is based on a simple regression model.
Linear Regression is a model that predicts the relationship between two variables ie, Independent Variable and 
Dependend Variable.


The simple maths behind Linear Regression is 
# y = m*x + c
Where y is dependent variable, x is independent variable


Change in x values changes y values 


The model tries to predict slope and intercept values tht best fits the data.
Using this we Visualize data and predict the best.

The data in student_scores can be visualized by the following commands



Before fitting the data, we get the following graph...

### df.plot(x = 'Hours',y = 'Scores', c= 'b',alpha=1,style= 'o')
### plt.title('hours utilized VS Scores obtained')
### plt.xlabel('Hours used for study')
### plt.ylabel('Scores obtained')
### plt.show()

After fitting the data we get a line like this below

Coming to Task2 
Its based on Unsupervised Learning Algorithm 
kMeans Algorithm is nothing but just clustering of data based on the centroids 
How does this work?
What simple statistics do we use 
Its too simple 
Euclidean distance

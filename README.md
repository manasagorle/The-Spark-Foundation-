This Task is based on a simple regression model.
Linear Regression is a model that predicts the relationship between two variables ie, Independent Variable and 
Dependend Variable.


The simple maths behind Linear Regression is 
# y = m*x + c
Where y is dependent variable, x is independent variable


Change in x values changes y values 


The model tries to predict slope and intercept values tht best fits the data.
Using this we Visualize data and predict the best.

The data in student_scores can be visualized by the following commands


## import plotnine as p
## dff = p.ggplot(data=df, mapping=p.aes(x=df['Hours'], y='Scores')) 
## dff + p.geom_line()
